Hey! Thanks for checking out my page. I’m doing my PhD at [NTU, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) with [Prof. Eddie](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=9QW1LYAAAAAJ). My work? Making sure stuff like food and vaccines stay cool during delivery. Because nobody wants warm ice cream or spoiled medicine, right?

I also mess around with vibrations and magnets to make heat move faster (enhance heat transfer). Yeah, it sounds fancy, but basically, it’s just trying to make things heat up or cool down quicker.

In the future, I’ve got my eyes set on underwater robots (who wouldn’t want to play with robots underwater?). Plus, I want to make computer programs faster so they don’t take forever to figure out heat and fluid problems.

I’m from Jaipur, went to [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) where [Prof. Suvanjan](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=IaZolwcAAAAJ&hl=en) was my mentor. After a quick stop at [IISc Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/), I ended up in Singapore for my PhD adventure.

When I’m not buried in research, you’ll probably find me jamming on some instruments or singing (usually in my room, and often late at night).
