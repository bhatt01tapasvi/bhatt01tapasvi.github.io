Hi there! Thanks for visiting my profile. As a PhD student at [NTU, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) with my supervisor [Prof. Eddie](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=9QW1LYAAAAAJ), I am exploring the dynamic intersection of artificial intelligence and machine learning within the field of cold chain logistics. My research is dedicated to optimizing the transportation of temperature-sensitive goods, ensuring they arrive in perfect condition, thereby enhancing supply chain efficiency.

Beyond my primary focus, I am actively engaged in several interdisciplinary projects. One of my key interests lies in heat transfer enhancement, where I investigate innovative active methods, such as utilizing vibrations and magnetic fields to improve thermal efficiency.

Looking to the future, I am excited to delve into the realm of underwater robotics, aiming to contribute to significant advancements in marine technology. Additionally, I aspire to revolutionize traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) practices by integrating machine learning techniques with finite element methods, paving the way for more efficient and accurate simulations.

Originally from Jaipur, I relocated to Pilani to pursue my Bachelors in Mechanical from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) with [Prof. Suvanjan](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=IaZolwcAAAAJ&hl=en) as my thesis supervisor. After completing my degree, I had a very brief stint at [IISc Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/) after which, I moved to Singapore to pursue my PhD. An avid music person, I enjoy learning various instruments and singing.
