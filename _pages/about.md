Hey! Thanks for checking out my page. I’m doing my PhD at [NTU, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) with [Prof. Eddie](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=9QW1LYAAAAAJ).

My work? Making sure stuff like food and vaccines stay cool during delivery. Because nobody wants warm ice cream or spoiled medicine, right? I also mess around with vibrations and magnets to make heat move faster (enhance heat transfer). Yeah, it sounds fancy, but basically, it’s just trying to make things heat up or cool down quicker. Plus, I keep on looking for new problems, but unfortunately keep jumping, hopefully I'll be able to stick with my current interest in using CNN for PIV.

For those who want to dive into the technicals:

My current work revolves around cold chain logistics using Phase Change Materials (PCM) to maximize the thermal durability of cold boxes, specifically for vaccine transport. This involves fine-tuning heat transfer mechanisms and implementing real-time monitoring systems. My focus is on extending operational longevity while maintaining sustainability metrics.

I’m actively researching heat transfer enhancement through magnetic fields and vibrational techniques. My approach integrates entropic and exergetic analysis with first law efficiency optimization to drive higher thermal performance.

On the computational side, I’m exploring the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to push the limits of flow measurement accuracy. I’m aiming to develop an algorithm that outperforms current benchmarks in this domain. However, I’m flexible in my focus and might pivot depending on emerging technical challenges and innovations.

I’m from Jaipur, went to [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) where [Prof. Suvanjan](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=IaZolwcAAAAJ&hl=en) was my mentor. After a quick stop at [IISc Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/), I ended up in Singapore for my PhD adventure.

When I’m not buried in research, you’ll probably find me jamming on some instruments or singing (usually in my room, and often late at night).
