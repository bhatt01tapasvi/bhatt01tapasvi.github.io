I'm curious about everything from cold chain logistics to particle image velocimetry, and I change research fields almost as often as my playlists. I earned a dual degree in Mechanical Engineering and an M.Sc. in Chemistry from BITS Pilani, where I worked with <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/suvanjan-bhattacharyya/" target="_blank">Dr. Suvanjan Bhattacharyya</a> on thermal system analysis. Now I'm pursuing my PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at NTU Singapore with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9QW1LYAAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Eddie</a>, focusing on phase-change materials and AI for vaccine cold chains. What's next? Honestly, I'm figuring it out as I go. Stay tuned!</p>

                                <p>In order to increase the redundancy of a service (details omitted), I had to port its distributed locking system from a third party service to AWS DynamoDB so that multiple entities could view the lock state of other entities around them. This required a deep understanding of how the system's locking actually worked, and writing rigorous tests to ensure that the overhaul was actually correct. To use a good phrase from a mentor of mine, I felt that this project bizarrely validated most traditional computer science undergraduate curricula.</p>

                                <p>My first project as a junior engineer was to build a service that detects abrupt drops in certain arenas of the video system's traffic. These drops are colloquially referred to as 'black holes', and the service is somewhat cheekily called LIGO. LIGO runs on AWS ECS/Fargate and connects to SQS, Kinesis, and Apache Druid. I architected, coded, and productionized the system entirely on my own, and gained a lot of experience on the journey.</p>

I updated the previous algorithm (which implemented equal cost multipathing, UCMP's more inefficent predecessor) and worked with a colleague on the networking team to test the code live on the network. This project was yet another step in my journey to understand how exactly the internet works, something that I likely will never understand.</p>

The chapter we decided to prototype with was the one about generative adversarial networks (GANs) due to the project lead's personal interest in them. </p>

                                <p> A great deal of time was spent on the interaction design of the website itself, and keeping both the landing pages and the learning material itself as easy to navigate as possible for learners and users of all ages and levels. For example, we determined that while the color scheme and design should remain the same throughout the website, the "feel" (font, UI) should change between content levels. </p>

                                <p> We also wanted to make AI seem approachable, not futuristic, dark, chrome colored, or hacker-y. We considered naturalistic themes and light colors in opposition to the typical depiction of AI in media.</p>

                                <p> At the beginning of the project, I worked along with another student in charge of web design to wireframe out the look and feel of the website. I went through several of the educational websites that I used on a daily basis and tried to pick out the elements that I found the most natural and usable, and then combine these into a design. The web designer took my fairly simple ideas and gave them a great deal of color. </p>

                                <p>Halfway through the project, however, the web designer got too busy, and I was left with coming up with the visual design elements of the website as well.

                                <p> This project taught me a great deal about designing UI and thinking very deeply about my user.

                                <p>On their own, these websites were fairly small projects in the scope of things. However, tooling away on them gave me a much better feel for web dev and UI design that is coming in useful for this portfolio website in particular. The increase in my HTML/CSS skills has been, frankly, astronomical compared to where I started from. I used to find it insufferably frustrating, but now, working on these websites induces a sense of comfort and satisfaction in me similar to doing my laundry or cleaning my room. That feels like a huge improvement.

                                <p>Like many triple A game studios, Santa Monica Studio utilizes a custom built engine for God of War. As such, the tool for tweaking settings within said engine was also custom designed, and was over a decade old when I was tasked with creating a more modern prototype.</p>

                                <p>I was tasked with using the <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGui</a> library to create this prototype. ImGui is an open source C++ library for creating user interfaces, primarily for game engines and other real-time 3D applications.</p>

                                <p>This was my first time working with a codebase on a massive scale. I learned how to parse through huge chunks of relatively undocumented code, and gained an intuition for how to look for the code actually relevant to my needs. I had also never worked with an external library as big as ImGui, so figuring out how to integrate it into the existing PlayStation codebase was a slow task.</p>

                                <p>I also learned what it was like to have multiple stakeholders for a system. Designers, artists, and programmers all used the engine debugging tool in different ways, and had different opinions on the changes that should be made to it. From the way the PS4 controller was used to navigate the menu, to the actual widgets used for certain features themselves, I learned the importance of taking multiple voices into account when creating an end product for a variety of users.</p>

                                <p>The biggest challenge I faced was struggling through the nuances of C++. I learned that low-level programming is definitely not my forte, and the intricacies of buffer overflows and overwritten caches did not bring me much joy. But in the end, the experience of working in a triple A studio on such a huge project was worth all the frustration. As a small contributor, I'm excited for the world to see God of War: Ragnarok, and as a fan of the franchise, I'm dying to play it myself!</p>

                                <p> An important feature for AR games, which happen both in real locations and in real-time - is time! When I joined the TaleBlazer project, some of the most highly requested features from users were time-based event blocks, in which a user could trigger an event using elapsed time. My task was to brainstorm, prototype, and implement the best set of blocks for users to achieve this functionality.</p>

                                <p>I began with brainstorming a variety of time-based features that could come in handy in a location-based AR game:</p>

                                <p>I then created paper prototypes and iterated upon them multiple times before finally moving on to implementation. The TaleBlazer backend is written in Javascript on top of a CakePHP backend. I primarily wrote Javascript in Android Studio, and built countless iterations of the app onto an old Android phone. The final result was that these three blocks were added to the TaleBlazer programming language:</p>

                                <p> My project for TaleBlazer was, in itself, relatively simple. However, this summer was absolutely instrumental to my growth as an engineer for several other reasons. I learned how to use Git, and managed, committed to, and pull requested branches with my chcanges. I learned the process of prototyping and adding user requested features, and learned how to go through several iterations of ideation. I learned how to adjust to different development environments, and code in languages that I had never encountered before. For all of these reasons, my summer at TaleBlazer will likely remain the most formative summer of my career.</p>

With my blog posts, I contributed to a small amount of those pageviews with a variety of different types of blog posts: <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/doors-of-east-campus/">compilations</a> of <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the-november-rule/">MIT</a> <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/murals-of-east-campus/">culture</a>, several <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/an-unnecessarily-long-post-on-how-much-i-like-spotify/">enthusiastic</a> <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/bloggers-wrapped-2019/">posts</a> about <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/blogger-wrapped-2020/">Spotify</a>, and some <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-comprehensive-guide-to-crying-on-campus/">minorly viral</a> <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-comprehensive-guide-to-vending-machines-at-mit/">data</a> <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/a-comprehensive-guide-to-my-favorite-places-on-campus/">visualizations</a>. Compiling most of these posts helped me develop what I now consider to be a life skill: shamelessly asking large groups of people to provide me with similarly large amounts of data. At some point, I even had a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/beaverconfessions/posts/2194647610604274?__xts__[0]=68.ARBmpCcfUtAE3ugcuPxOYmMTh3MmjsHZZ5smzAmslB3NS7rHrEq8j0hqII7d49QhnPu56rAI4SAVaZEsUltCjjcy0l40ty4z6zouKdzUScjI-s-SVaKQyejF7tKQYJrruxUNZxmbCXyfRKuJZAUML5_r1MwxPxWrEHTeboQrSwQdQlmEU63md1bjC3LD0R9w1DTjoii8352QdrzM81OoNQGfY85DDW-MlDoFZ8sBHkAvAdQ2Bpv4va8veasF_sebs5Grs6QaDAr43D4v220gWYVkAyHYFYa_tjcUxZTXW1M1zjGlRromscXwvXrolExYBsuO6HneYF-kI5GH5SndFA">salty MIT Confessions post</a> written about just <i>how</i> shameless I was. However, I firmly believe that these experiences built character, and will serve me well in the working world. When I need to get something done, I'll get it done.</p>

                                <p>I had never written for such a large audience before, and it was both strange and gratifying to receive comments and emails from incoming students telling me how much my blogs resonated with them on different levels. Being told that my blogs were the reason that a student applied to MIT certainly ranks among the more touching experiences in my life. In the grand scheme of things, the impact of my blogs on the internet was quite small, but if they could change even a few people's life trajectories, then I think my quest as a writer has been fulfilled. </p>

                                <p>As a blogger and humanities major, I’ve generated a decent amount of writing over the years. The selected pieces below showcase some of the work that I’ve done, spanning a wide range of writing styles and topics. These do not include my publications, which you can find in their rightful place on my CV.</p>
                                <h3>Blogging</h3>
                                <p>I was an MIT Admissions blogger for my 3.5 years of undergrad and wrote on the order of ~100 posts on my life and experiences as an MIT student. There were a couple of blogs I wrote that resonated with a fairly large audience:

To this day, I still occasionally get a message from a friend saying how helpful this was, even though it just seemed like a dumb and random idea at the time.</li>

                                <h3>Gaming</h3>
                                <p>My interest in video games led me to take nearly all of the gaming adjacent classes that MIT had to offer. I got to live my dream and write several academic papers on various facets of the gaming world. This prepared me well to write semi-professionally about games - I have two chapters upcoming in the <i>Psychgeist of Pop Culture</i> series, which explores our favorite video games through academic analyses written for a general audience.

                                        <li><i>Psychgeist of Pop Culture: Final Fantasy VII</i>: Getting to write a chapter about Final Fantasy VII that will be published in an actual book is definitely a dream come true. My chapter, titled <i>Shinra at the Intersection of Science, Technology, and Society</i>, explores the Shinra company as a technocapitalist entity that has evolved in meaning and significance in the three decades since the game's release.</li>
                                        <li><i>Psychgeist of Pop Culture: Stardew Valley</i>": Stardew Valley was the game that helped my partner and I transition to a long distance relationship when I started my PhD. In my chapter titled <i>Domesticating Bliss: Facilitating Long-Distance Relationships Through Stardew Valley Co-op Mode</i>, I write about the mechanics and design affordances that make Stardew Valley such a compelling game for couples in LDRs.</li>

                                <h3>Ethnographic</h3>
                                <p>As a comparative media studies major, I occasionally had to go out into the field to investigate the effect of media on the people around me, and learn to use the data gathered to form research questions and create narratives. As a positive result, I was pushed farther out of my comfort zone than I could have ever gone by myself.

I would love to do more in the future, and expand upon some of the work I started in this class.

                                <p>The Science+C project is a collaboration between the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to create an alternate pathway to college and science careers for high school students by developing and testing three new computational science courses. These courses—Computational Biology, Computational Chemistry, and Computational Physics—will be available to all Massachusetts high schools beginning in the 2022-2023 school year.</p>

I'm starting with streaming my very favorite game - Final Fantasy VII, if that wasn't obvious from the rest of this site - and I'm hoping to stream more of the classic Final Fantasies, playing guitar, and maybe - just maybe - myself applying to grad school. Reaching Partner status seems like a lofty goal, but I'd like to at least reach Affiliate.</p>

                            So, July 2025. I found myself at the University of Tokyo’s International Research Camp, right next to the scenic Yamanaka River with Mount Fuji casually photobombing every group selfie. The camp gathered 46 participants - two seasoned researchers from the industry and a caffeine-charged squad of 44 PhD students hailing from ten universities across several countries and regions. Our mission? In teams of eight, dream up and design an innovative device for future factories.

                            So what’s this “Smart 3-in-1 Physical Separation Device”? Glad you asked. It’s a high-tech plastic sorting wizard that combines three physical separation methods—electrostatic, acoustic resonance, and electromagnetic (EM) fields—to pull apart mixed plastics with over 90-95% accuracy. While commercial systems often rely on Near-Infrared (NIR) or visible light spectra, they stumble on dark or dirty plastics. Our device? It laughs in the face of moisture, darkness, and contamination.
                            </p>
    
                            <p>
                            Here’s how it works, step-by-step on the conveyor belt of fame:
                            </p>
    
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Electrostatic Separation:</b> Plastics get triboelectrically charged as they slide along the belt. Then, they pass through a high-voltage horizontal electric field (~40 kV), where their charge differences cause lateral deflection. This stage alone hits >95% sorting accuracy for many plastics.</li>
                                <li><b>Acoustic Resonance Separation:</b> Plastics vibrate differently based on their stiffness (Young’s modulus). We pump ~40 Hz acoustic waves, and their resonance amplitudes vary. Acoustic modules use these subtle shifts to split plastics, achieving around ~90% accuracy.</li>
                                <li><b>Electromagnetic (EM) Separation:</b> The real magic spark. A pulsed EM field at frequencies around 60 kHz and 100 kHz targets differential dielectric polarization dynamics. PET and PVC, for example, resonate with these frequencies differently—PVC, with chlorine atoms in its polymer chain, has higher dielectric loss and sticks to the belt longer at 100 kHz, while PET slides off. This stick-slip control lets us separate these plastics with >95% accuracy.</li>
                            </ul>
    
                            <p>
                            Why does this matter? Global plastics use is exploding—expected to nearly triple by 2060—and recycling rates still lag behind other materials. Mixed or contaminated waste often gets rejected or downcycled, losing valuable recyclable content. Our device aims to fix that by boosting sorting accuracy, reducing contamination, and enabling smarter factories without sacrificing throughput. Plus, it works well in real-world messy conditions—rain or shine, sticky or not.
                            </p>
    
                            <figure>

                            <p>
                            From my side, I dove deep into the physics and system modelling for the electromagnetic module, tuning the pulsed field frequencies and stick-slip parameters to cleanly separate PET and PVC. While the team built the device, I pinged external APAC collaborators to help validate the models and coordinated testing plans. It’s no small feat handling dielectric polarization with ionic dynamics on a conveyor belt!
                            </p>
    
                            <p>
                            Our prototype processes 50–1,500 kg/hour depending on configuration, with a modest footprint that can scale up for industrial recycling lines. Budget-wise, setup costs range from US$118k to 195k, including maintenance. Not bad for a device that could significantly cut landfill waste, improve recycled polymer purity, and ramp up factory efficiency.
                            </p>

                            After weeks of whiteboards packed with equations, sushi breaks, and late-night rapid prototyping, we had a working system that could sort plastics reliably, fast, and with minimal fuss—even sometimes shocking the professors in the best way.

                            The best part? This isn’t just lab curiosity. It’s a stepping stone for circular economies, a boost to sustainable manufacturing, and a meaningful contribution to tackling one of the biggest waste challenges globally. Plus, I now inspect every plastic bottle like a hawk. No escape.

                            <p>When I began my research in thermal fluid dynamics, I was drawn to the complex interplay between heat transfer mechanisms and electromagnetic effects in confined geometries. The rectangular channel configuration presents unique challenges in understanding how magnetic fields influence convective heat transfer while simultaneously dealing with flow-induced vibrations. This interdisciplinary approach combining thermal sciences, fluid mechanics, and electromagnetic theory became the foundation of my most technically challenging research project.</p>

                            <p>I'm only in my mid 20s, but people my age have lived through a huge amount of unrest - the first Trump administration, COVID, and the second - much more fascist - Trump administration, with very little mental break in between. In both personal and environmental times of darkness, I find myself going back to the games that have taught me strength, given me characters to model myself after, and given me a place where I feel like I can fight back against evil. I firmly believe that playing games like Final Fantasy VII in my formative years - all about how a giant corporation destroys the world through capitalism and greed - has been key to shaping my own will to live on and fight on. With that in mind, the area I hope to write my dissertation on someday is in how playing games can support eudaimonic well-being, human flourishing, and mental health. Games for mental health are often discussed in the language of escapism, but I think there are a lot of important lessons we can learn from our ability to agentically interact with stories of resistance, resilience, and heroism within games.</p>

                                <p>After wading around in readings about self-determination theory, narrative games, and eudaimonic well-being, I identified a theoretical gap that had mysteriously gone unfilled. Media studies scholars have elaborated extensively on why a person may seek out a eudaimonic gaming experience, but the long lasting effects of such experiences were unknown. Partly motivated by getting to read about peoples' positive and life-changing experiences with games, I conducted a large survey that received 100+ responses, and conducted a structured deductive analysis to identify pathways to certain types of changes that people believed these gaming experiences had on their broader lives. As this work is under submission, I won't go into too much more detail, but I expect this to be the foundation of much of my future work.</p>

                                <p>The games that have supported my mental health have always been narrative heavy RPGs. In my first year, I took a particular interest in narrative games, and like a good junior PhD student, I decided to do my first systematic review on how narrative game-based interveions are used in mental health research. Myself and Jamie Espinosa-Briones (DUB REU '24) reduced almost 2000 papers down to 17 games for analysis. A preliminary analysis (results to be presented at DiGRA '25) revealed that a majority of the games surrounded treatment for depression and anxiety; however, how these constructs were measured differed significantly between studies. In addition, theoretical underpinnings such as narrative theory (popuarlized by communications scholars) were often overlooked in the design of these games. In future discussion (journal paper coming soon), we intend to suggest design guidelines for further cross-collaboration between communication studies, mental health, and human-computer interaction. </p>
