I'm curious about everything from cold chain logistics to particle image velocimetry, and I change research fields almost as often as my playlists. I earned a dual degree in Mechanical Engineering and an M.Sc. in Chemistry from BITS Pilani, where I worked with <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/suvanjan-bhattacharyya/" target="_blank">Dr. Suvanjan Bhattacharyya</a> on thermal system analysis. Now I'm pursuing my PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at NTU Singapore with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9QW1LYAAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Eddie</a>, focusing on phase-change materials and AI for vaccine cold chains. What's next? Honestly, I'm figuring it out as I go. Stay tuned!</p>

                                <p>In order to increase the redundancy of a service (details omitted), I had to port its distributed locking system from a third party service to AWS DynamoDB so that multiple entities could view the lock state of other entities around them. This required a deep understanding of how the system's locking actually worked, and writing rigorous tests to ensure that the overhaul was actually correct. To use a good phrase from a mentor of mine, I felt that this project bizarrely validated most traditional computer science undergraduate curricula.</p>

                                <p>My first project as a junior engineer was to build a service that detects abrupt drops in certain arenas of the video system's traffic. These drops are colloquially referred to as 'black holes', and the service is somewhat cheekily called LIGO. LIGO runs on AWS ECS/Fargate and connects to SQS, Kinesis, and Apache Druid. I architected, coded, and productionized the system entirely on my own, and gained a lot of experience on the journey.</p>

I updated the previous algorithm (which implemented equal cost multipathing, UCMP's more inefficent predecessor) and worked with a colleague on the networking team to test the code live on the network. This project was yet another step in my journey to understand how exactly the internet works, something that I likely will never understand.</p>

The goal of GenAI was to design such a platform for learners of all levels. We intended to create a prototype to hand off to professional designers.</p>

                                <p> The platform GenAI was intended to be an online textbook with several chapters about different AI topics, such as neural networks, conversational agents, and robotics, among several others. The chapter we decided to prototype with was the one about generative adversarial networks (GANs) due to the project lead's personal interest in them. </p>

                                <p> A great deal of time was spent on the interaction design of the website itself, and keeping both the landing pages and the learning material itself as easy to navigate as possible for learners and users of all ages and levels. For example, we determined that while the color scheme and design should remain the same throughout the website, the "feel" (font, UI) should change between content levels. </p>

                                <p> We also wanted to make AI seem approachable, not futuristic, dark, chrome colored, or hacker-y. We considered naturalistic themes and light colors in opposition to the typical depiction of AI in media.</p>

                                <p> At the beginning of the project, I worked along with another student in charge of web design to wireframe out the look and feel of the website. I went through several of the educational websites that I used on a daily basis and tried to pick out the elements that I found the most natural and usable, and then combine these into a design. The web designer took my fairly simple ideas and gave them a great deal of color. </p>

                                <p>Halfway through the project, however, the web designer got too busy, and I was left with coming up with the visual design elements of the website as well. In accordance with our naturalistic ideas for representing AI, I chose a color palette, designed a v1 logo, and created a moodboard. </p>

                                <p>I was also assigned to write the beginner and intermediate levels of a GANs textbook chapter. This was the first time that I had to think deeply about what it meant to be a learner at each of these levels, and be mindful to use appropriate terminology and complexity. Similarly, we designed the visuals to "level up" as well. </p>

                                <p> This project taught me a great deal about designing UI and thinking very deeply about my user.

                                <p>On their own, these websites were fairly small projects in the scope of things. However, tooling away on them gave me a much better feel for web dev and UI design that is coming in useful for this portfolio website in particular. The increase in my HTML/CSS skills has been, frankly, astronomical compared to where I started from. I used to find it insufferably frustrating, but now, working on these websites induces a sense of comfort and satisfaction in me similar to doing my laundry or cleaning my room. That feels like a huge improvement.

                                <p>Like many triple A game studios, Santa Monica Studio utilizes a custom built engine for God of War. As such, the tool for tweaking settings within said engine was also custom designed, and was over a decade old when I was tasked with creating a more modern prototype.</p>

                                <p>I was tasked with using the <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGui</a> library to create this prototype. ImGui is an open source C++ library for creating user interfaces, primarily for game engines and other real-time 3D applications.</p>

                                <p>This was my first time working with a codebase on a massive scale. I learned how to parse through huge chunks of relatively undocumented code, and gained an intuition for how to look for the code actually relevant to my needs. I had also never worked with an external library as big as ImGui, so figuring out how to integrate it into the existing PlayStation codebase was a slow task.</p>

                                <p>I also learned what it was like to have multiple stakeholders for a system. Designers, artists, and programmers all used the engine debugging tool in different ways, and had different opinions on the changes that should be made to it. From the way the PS4 controller was used to navigate the menu, to the actual widgets used for certain features themselves, I learned the importance of taking multiple voices into account when creating an end product for a variety of users.</p>

                                <p>The biggest challenge I faced was struggling through the nuances of C++. I learned that low-level programming is definitely not my forte, and the intricacies of buffer overflows and overwritten caches did not bring me much joy. But in the end, the experience of working in a triple A studio on such a huge project was worth all the frustration. As a small contributor, I'm excited for the world to see God of War: Ragnarok, and as a fan of the franchise, I'm dying to play it myself!</p>

                                <p> An important feature for AR games, which happen both in real locations and in real-time - is time! When I joined the TaleBlazer project, some of the most highly requested features from users were time-based event blocks, in which a user could trigger an event using elapsed time. My task was to brainstorm, prototype, and implement the best set of blocks for users to achieve this functionality.</p>

                                <p>I began with brainstorming a variety of time-based features that could come in handy in a location-based AR game:</p>

                                <p>I then created paper prototypes and iterated upon them multiple times before finally moving on to implementation. The TaleBlazer backend is written in Javascript on top of a CakePHP backend. I primarily wrote Javascript in Android Studio, and built countless iterations of the app onto an old Android phone. The final result was that these three blocks were added to the TaleBlazer programming language:</p>

                                <p> My project for TaleBlazer was, in itself, relatively simple. However, this summer was absolutely instrumental to my growth as an engineer for several other reasons. I learned how to use Git, and managed, committed to, and pull requested branches with my chcanges. I learned the process of prototyping and adding user requested features, and learned how to go through several iterations of ideation. I learned how to adjust to different development environments, and code in languages that I had never encountered before. For all of these reasons, my summer at TaleBlazer will likely remain the most formative summer of my career.</p>

Compiling most of these posts helped me develop what I now consider to be a life skill: shamelessly asking large groups of people to provide me with similarly large amounts of data. At some point, I even had a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/beaverconfessions/posts/2194647610604274?__xts__[0]=68.ARBmpCcfUtAE3ugcuPxOYmMTh3MmjsHZZ5smzAmslB3NS7rHrEq8j0hqII7d49QhnPu56rAI4SAVaZEsUltCjjcy0l40ty4z6zouKdzUScjI-s-SVaKQyejF7tKQYJrruxUNZxmbCXyfRKuJZAUML5_r1MwxPxWrEHTeboQrSwQdQlmEU63md1bjC3LD0R9w1DTjoii8352QdrzM81OoNQGfY85DDW-MlDoFZ8sBHkAvAdQ2Bpv4va8veasF_sebs5Grs6QaDAr43D4v220gWYVkAyHYFYa_tjcUxZTXW1M1zjGlRromscXwvXrolExYBsuO6HneYF-kI5GH5SndFA">salty MIT Confessions post</a> written about just <i>how</i> shameless I was. However, I firmly believe that these experiences built character, and will serve me well in the working world. When I need to get something done, I'll get it done.</p>

                                <p>I had never written for such a large audience before, and it was both strange and gratifying to receive comments and emails from incoming students telling me how much my blogs resonated with them on different levels. Being told that my blogs were the reason that a student applied to MIT certainly ranks among the more touching experiences in my life. In the grand scheme of things, the impact of my blogs on the internet was quite small, but if they could change even a few people's life trajectories, then I think my quest as a writer has been fulfilled. </p>

                        <p>’ve always been into bikes, honestly since Jaipur days. First one was a Hero Glamour, that 125cc. Not a crazy machine but it got me hooked. I still remember fiddling with the carb, checking plugs, learning the sound of the engine when it’s happy. Then came the Ignitor. That one felt like a step up, smoother gearbox, better pull, I used to ride it Jaipur to Pilani so many times. That bike had my heart. One day it just got stolen, and man, that hurt.</p>
                        <p>Now I’m in Singapore, riding a Honda CB190X Tourism. It’s got that liquid-cooled single, 190cc (ik it's not that fancy, but my license here limits me to 200cc, so that's the best deal I could get), fuel injection, enough power to keep me smiling but also comfy for longer runs. The upright stance feels right, suspension soaks the bumps better than my old rides. What I love most is late-night rides, streets empty, throttle response quick, wind hitting the helmet, engine humming steady.</p>
                        <p>I sometimes record as well, here's a sample:</p>

I'm starting with streaming my very favorite game - Final Fantasy VII, if that wasn't obvious from the rest of this site - and I'm hoping to stream more of the classic Final Fantasies, playing guitar, and maybe - just maybe - myself applying to grad school.

                            <p>Our "Smart 3-in-1 Physical Separation Device" is a high-tech plastic sorting system that combines three physical separation methods—electrostatic, acoustic resonance, and electromagnetic (EM) fields—to achieve over 90-95% accuracy in separating mixed plastics. Unlike commercial systems that rely on Near-Infrared (NIR) or visible light spectra and struggle with dark or contaminated plastics, our device works effectively even in messy real-world conditions.</p>
                            
                            <figure>

                            </figure>

                            <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>1. Electrostatic Separation:</strong> Plastics get triboelectrically charged as they slide along the belt, then pass through a high-voltage electric field (~40 kV) where charge differences cause lateral deflection, achieving >95% sorting accuracy.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>2. Acoustic Resonance Separation:</strong> Using ~40 Hz acoustic waves, plastics vibrate differently based on their stiffness (Young's modulus), allowing separation with ~90% accuracy through resonance amplitude variations.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>3. Electromagnetic (EM) Separation:</strong> The breakthrough component. Pulsed EM fields at 60 kHz and 100 kHz target differential dielectric polarization dynamics. PVC, with chlorine atoms in its polymer chain, has higher dielectric loss and sticks to the belt longer at 100 kHz, while PET slides off, enabling >95% separation accuracy.</p>

                            </figure>

                            <p>My primary contribution focused on the physics and system modeling for the electromagnetic module, tuning the pulsed field frequencies and stick-slip parameters to cleanly separate PET and PVC. I coordinated with external APAC collaborators to validate our models and developed comprehensive testing plans for handling dielectric polarization with ionic dynamics on a conveyor belt.</p>

                            <p><strong>Impact and Specifications:</strong> Our prototype processes 50–1,500 kg/hour depending on configuration, with setup costs ranging from US$118k to 195k including maintenance. With global plastics use expected to nearly triple by 2060, this device addresses a critical need by boosting sorting accuracy, reducing contamination, and enabling smarter factories without sacrificing throughput.</p>

This isn't just academic curiosity—it's a stepping stone for circular economies, sustainable manufacturing, and a meaningful contribution to tackling global waste challenges.</p>

                            <div class="left-align">

                                <p>Okay, let’s talk about making things hot—well, technically, making them cool down faster. My research in heat transfer enhancement is all about squeezing every bit of efficiency out of systems like mini-channels, whether it’s for solar panels, electric vehicle batteries, or industrial heat exchangers. The secret sauce? Magnetic nanofluids, mechanical vibrations, and a sprinkle of magnetic fields to stir things up.</p>
                                <p>I’ve been geeking out over how nanoparticles suspended in fluids can supercharge heat transfer, especially when you shake things up—literally—with vibrations or apply a magnetic field to make those particles dance. For instance, we found that tweaking vibration frequency in a mini-channel can boost thermal performance by generating secondary flows that disrupt boring old boundary layers. Add a magnetic field, and the nanofluid starts behaving like it’s auditioning for a sci-fi movie, enhancing heat transfer coefficients like nobody’s business. This work has been a wild ride, from solar panel cooling to EV battery management, and it’s landed in journals like <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rineng.2023.101473">Results in Engineering</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10407782.2024.2382492">Numerical Heat Transfer</a>.</p>
                                <p>Oh, and the exergy analysis? That’s where we get nerdy about energy quality, figuring out how to minimize waste in these systems. It’s like teaching a heat exchanger to be less of a slacker. Currently, we’re pushing the boundaries further, exploring how these techniques can make industrial systems greener and more efficient. Stay tuned—I’m probably in a lab right now, trying not to overheat myself while cooling something else.</p>
