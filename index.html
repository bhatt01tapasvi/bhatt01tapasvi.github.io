            In 2018, I graduated from <a href='https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/'>Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani</a> with a dual degree in Mechanical Engineering and Master of Science in Chemistry with a CGPA of 8.4/10. During my undergraduate studies, I worked under the supervision of <a href='https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/suvanjan-bhattacharyya/'>Dr. Suvanjan Bhattacharyya</a> on various projects, including entropy and exergy analysis in heat exchangers.<br> 
    
            Currently, I am pursuing my Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in the <a href='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/mae'>School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</a> at <a href='https://www.ntu.edu.sg/'>Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</a> under the guidance of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9QW1LYAAAAAJ&hl=en'>Prof. Eddie</a>. My research focuses on optimizing cold chain logistics for vaccine transport using phase-change materials and incorporating artificial intelligence for better thermal management.<br> 
    
            Also, I’m a chameleon, shifting research areas like my mood; from cold chain logistics to PIV image processing with deep learning. What’s next? I also don't know. Stay tuned!<br>

                    <br><br> Currently, I am working under the guidance of <a href='http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~kolin/Kolins_Web_Home/My_Home.html'>Prof. Kolin Paul</a> at the <a href='https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in//'>Department of Computer Science and Engineering,</a>                    IIT Delhi. We are developing an Embedded System device which can be integrated with an ophthalmoscope. Our device uses a Raspberry Pi-3 processor and a Raspberry Pi camera to record videos of the retina through the ophthalmoscope.
                    The videos are sampled and the resulting images are processed to quantify the amount of Pulsations near the opticla disc by measuring and recording the time variation of diameter of blood vessels. The variations in diameter of the
                    blood vessels are further processed to predict ECG and detect the presence of major systemic vascular diseases, including ischemia, coronary heart diseases, and diabetes mellitus and its complications.<br>

                    IIT Delhi. We used MATLAB to implement various 4G (LTE and A-LTE) and 5G modulation techniques including OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing), SC-FDM (Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiplexing), GFDM ( General Frequency
                    Division Multiplexing), F-OFDM (Filtered OFDM), UFMC (Universal Filter Multi-Carrier modulation) and FBMC (Filter Bank Multi-Carrier modulation). We have setup an Analog Photoinc Link (APL) and have incorporated a wireless transmission
                    link after the APL, using dipole-log periodic and horn antennas. We also analyzed the APL for various characterictics like SFDR (Spurious Free Dynamic Range), DR (Dynamic Range), NF (Noise Figure) and G (Link Gain) through experimental
                    setup. We were analyzing the modulated waveforms after passing them through the APL for various characteristics like EVM (Error Vector Magnitude), BER (Bit Error Rate), PAPR (Peak to Average Power Ratio), etc.

We developed Felxible KNN (Potassium Sodium Niobate) based tactile sensors. We used sol-gel based method to synthesize KNN inorder to reduce the thermal budget
                    of the devices. We optimized the KNN sol layer and the design of the device. We used metal (Al and W) deposited via PVD (Physical Vapour Deposition) technique as the substrate for the devices. We characterized the devices for various
                    parameters like Pressure Sensitivity, Flexibility, Decay rate etc. Data was collected using Labview program and was analyzed using MATLAB.<br> Our work was presented at the <a href='https://www.mrs.org/61st-emc'>EMC (Electronic Materials Conference)</a>                    held at the University of Michigan from June 26, 2019 to June 28, 2019.

We applied high electric field on thin deposited KNN films. We analyzed the effect of the electric field on the material using SEM images, AFM
                    measurements and EDX measurements. We used MATLAB to claculate the percentage volume reduction in the material.<br> Our work was presented at the <a href='https://www.mrs.org/fall2019'>MRS (Materials Research Society)</a> 2019 fall
